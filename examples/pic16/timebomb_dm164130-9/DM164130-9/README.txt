About this Example
==================
This directory contains the board support package (bsp) for the simple "Timebomb" QPN-PIC16 example application for the Microchip DM164130-9 board. This directory contains the code, header, and documentation files used to interface the board hardware with the software.  Additionally, some files used to port (or configure) the QPN-PIC16 into the final application code.  These files should process correctly with the selected toolchain.Documentation Files===================41440B - PIC16F1825-1829.pdf - Microchip datasheet for the device usecd to run the code41628B - PICkit 3 Starter Kit Users Guide.pdf - Datasheet for the PICkit3 programmer/debuggerPICkit 3 LPC Demo Board SCH.pdf - schematic of the DM164130-9 boardApplication port files======================qfn_port.h - header file used to define the inclusion of the Hsm module into the QF-[micro] framework as controlled by the build configurations.bsp.h - board support package interface (header) filebsp.c - board support package implementation (source) fileDM164130-9.h - interface of the bsp and application header file.
